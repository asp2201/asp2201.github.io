Hi! I’m **Ally Peccia** (she/her), a **Ph.D. candidate in Earth & Environmental Sciences at Columbia University** (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), advised by **Terry Plank**. My dissertation is titled **_“Hellfire and Brimstone: Sulfur recycling at subduction zones and the interplay between volcanoes and climate.”_**【:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}】

## Research interests
I study **volcano–climate interactions**, with a focus on【:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}】:
- Explosive eruptions and their impacts
- Climatic drivers of volcanism on geologic timescales
- Cycling of volatiles (especially sulfur) through subduction zones

## Highlights
- **Sulfur isotopes & subduction:** resolving the “sulfur isotope discrepancy” and what it implies for sulfur inputs/outputs in arcs.
- **Eruptions & climate:** multidisciplinary constraints on stratospheric sulfur injection and forcing (e.g., Okmok II, 43 BCE).
- **IODP Expedition 398 (Hellenic Arc):** using submarine drill cores to extend eruption records and constrain volatile budgets.

## Mentoring
- **Megan Marostica** (2024–present): Poás volcano timescales & volatile budget  
- **Elliot Molz** (2024–present): Santorini early caldera-forming eruption storage conditions  
- **Violet Thompson** (2024): undergraduate research work-study  
- **Sharothy Mahmud** (2021–2022): olivine diffusion chronometry (Cleveland 2016)【:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}】
